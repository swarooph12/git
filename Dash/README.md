# Dash Online Data Science Dashboard using Plotly

## A Python project to analyse Facebook Stock Market performance and its key metrics

In this project I created an online dashboard to interactively analyse and visualize two different datasets. <br>

The first dataset is about stock prices. In this Dashboard, I an fact compare Facebook stock market performances with other companies such as Tesla, Microsoft and Apple. This dataset is available to download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs/downloads/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs.zip/3). <br>

The second dataset used to analyse Facebook Performance Metrics (eg. likes per post, paid vs free posts distributions), is instead available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296316000813?via%3Dihub). <br>

Additionally, a Machine Learning approach to analyse these two datasets is proposed.

This dashboard can be tested live using this [link.](https://salty-tor-65518.herokuapp.com/) Additionally, it is also possible to access this dashboard through my personal [WebSite.](https://pierpaolo28.github.io/) <br>

If you are looking for an written explaination on how to create this dashboard, I wrote a step by step guide on [Towards Data Science.](https://towardsdatascience.com/interactive-dashboards-for-data-science-51aa038279e5) <br>
